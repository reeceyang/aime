# AIME Challenger
This project is like Art of Probleming Solving's MathCounts Trainer (https://artofproblemsolving.com/mathcounts_trainer) but for AIME problems. Ideally the end result will have a similar interface, and will allow login using Facebook and Google to store user statistics.

Currently, functions in problem.js are able to get any AIME problem and solution off the AoPS wiki (https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). There are still some bugs, as entries in the wiki are somewhat inconsistent. Next steps include creating a system to display a problem and to accept an answer.

Originally this project was supposed to motivate me to study AIME problems by collecting information on how many problems I did each day and deciding whether I would be rewarded or not. You can still see remnants of this in the source code.

If you have any suggestions or comments, go ahead and create an issue. Thank you for your interest!
